# Egeria

A small AI agent for local notes, tasks, and guided thinking. Built on
Bun, the Vercel AI SDK, and Effect.

## Setup

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and set API_KEY to your Google Vertex (express-mode) API key
```

Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) or
the Vertex AI console.

## Run

```bash
bun run dev
```

## Test

```bash
bun test
```

## Project structure

Modules expose only their `index.ts`. Implementation details live under
each module's `internal/` folder.

```
